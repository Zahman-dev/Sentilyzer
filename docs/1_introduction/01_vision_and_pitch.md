# Sentilyzer Inc. - Investor Pitch and Strategic Plan

**Disclaimer:** This document is based on hypothetical data and market analysis. Its purpose is to demonstrate the thought process and necessary analyses in a business setup. The figures should be validated with actual market research.

---

## Section 1: Market Opportunity and Strategy

### 1.1. Detailed Market Analysis and Size (TAM/SAM/SOM)

**TAM (Total Addressable Market):** All individual stock market investors worldwide who are interested in analytical tools. **Estimate: ~150 Million people.**

**SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):** Retail investors in developed markets (North America, Europe) who are English-speaking and inclined to use technical tools (APIs, analytic dashboards). **Estimate: ~25 Million people.**

**SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):** Target market share we can reach in the first 3 years of launch through aggressive digital marketing and community building strategies.

- **Year 1 Target:** 1,000 paid users (~0.004% market share). **This is an achievable and realistic goal.**

**Note on Methodology:** The TAM/SAM figures are high-level, top-down estimates based on public data on retail investor populations. A key use of seed funding will be to conduct a more rigorous, bottom-up market analysis to validate these figures with greater precision.

### 1.2. In-Depth User Research and Persona

**Methodology:** Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 potential users (selected from r/algotrading and r/investing communities on Reddit).

**Key Findings:**

1. **"Validation Need":** Users need to "verify" their own analysis against market-wide sentiment.
2. **"Noise Filtering":** Users complain about information overload on Twitter and news feeds. They value tools that separate important signals from noise.
3. **Price Sensitivity:** Users are resistant to subscription fees above $50/month. $20-30 range is seen as "reasonable to try."

### 1.3. Price Model Validation

**Strategy:** `Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Measurement` methodology, will be used in a survey. Four questions will be asked to users: "At what price does this product become too expensive?", "At what price does it become expensive but you consider buying?", "At what price does it become a bargain?", "At what price does it become too cheap to doubt the quality?".

**Hypothesis:** The optimum price point is expected to be in the **$29 - $39/month** range. This validates our initial pricing strategy.

### 1.4. Competitive Advantage (Our Moat)

**"Why can't Bloomberg or others just build this?"**

Our competitive advantage is not based on a single, patentable technology, but on a combination of strategic choices that are difficult for large, established players to replicate:

1.  **Focus & Business Model Misalignment:** Our primary moat against incumbents like Bloomberg is their own business model. They serve high-value enterprise clients with a complex, expensive, all-in-one product. Building a low-cost, self-serve, API-first product for the retail market would distract them from their core business, risk cannibalizing their high-margin offerings, and require a completely different sales and support structure. It's not in their corporate DNA.
2.  **Speed & Agility:** As a lean startup, we can iterate on the product based on user feedback at a pace that is impossible for a large corporation. We can ship features weekly, not quarterly. This allows us to continuously adapt to the needs of our niche community.
3.  **Community & Brand:** We will build a strong community around our product through transparent development, content marketing, and direct engagement on platforms like Reddit and Twitter. This creates a loyal user base and a brand identity that is authentic and hard to replicate with a large corporate marketing budget.
4.  **Data & Network Effects (Future Moat):** As our user base grows, the backtesting data and strategy configurations they generate (anonymized and aggregated) will become a valuable asset, allowing us to identify popular strategies and further refine our models, creating a virtuous cycle.

## Section 2: Financial Projections and Business Model

### 2.1. Realistic User Growth and Revenue Projection (3-Year)

**Assumptions:**

- **Churn Rate (Loss Rate):** Monthly %5. (SaaS industry average).
- **Freemium to Paid Conversion Rate:** %4. (Industry average %2-5).
- **Marketing Investment:** Starting from $1000 monthly in Year 1 and increasing dynamically as revenue grows.

| Metric                   | Year 1 End         | Year 2 End         | Year 3 End         |
|--------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Total Registered Users** | 25,000             | 80,000             | 200,000            |
| **Paid Users (Pro)**       | 1,000              | 3,200              | 8,000              |
| **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** | ~$29,000           | ~$92,800           | ~$232,000          |
| **Yearly Recurring Revenue (ARR)** | ~$348,000          | ~$1.11 Million      | ~$2.78 Million      |

**Note:** Year 1 marketing budget is considered a starting point to support organic growth and community building efforts. Optimizing Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and achieving targeted user count may require this budget to be adjusted flexibly based on the obtained results.

### 2.2. Detailed Cost Structure

**Fixed Costs (Year 1 - Monthly):**

- **Server & Infrastructure (AWS/GCP):** ~$500 (Initial) -> ~$2,500 (After 1000 users)
- **Data API Licenses (If Needed):** ~$300
- **Software Licenses (Jira, Slack, etc.):** ~$100

**Variable Costs (Year 1 - Monthly):**

- **Marketing & Advertising:** ~$1,000 (Initial, CAC focused)
- **Transaction Costs (Stripe):** ~3% of revenue.

**Background Tasks (Background Jobs):** These will be handled asynchronously in the background using **centralized task queue (Task Queue - e.g: Celery & Redis)** to prevent users' API requests from being held up by long-running calculations (e.g: complex backtest), and also used for platform's basic data processing and periodic tasks. Results are notified to users when they are ready.

## Section 3: Acceptance of Technical Risks and Mitigation Strategies

### 3.1. Model's Financial Impact and Security Network

**Risk:** Model's incorrect "Buy" signal or simplified "Signal Generator" in MVP phase causing user to lose money and this situation is irremediable damage to brand reputation.

**Mitigation Strategy:**

1.  **Managing Expectations:** The module in MVP will be positioned as a "Duygu Data Provider" rather than a Buy/Sell signal generator. It will be explicitly stated in the interface and communication that its purpose is to provide basic duygu data (score, date, title) for users to make their own analysis, without directly providing a Buy/Sell signal or being a Buy/Sell recommendation.
2.  **"Confidence Score" Metric:** API will return a "confidence score" along with each duygu analysis result. If there are few news or unclear texts, this score will be low. The interface will display low confidence score signals in a different color (e.g: yellow) to alert users.
3.  **Correlation Not Causation Warning:** The interface will display an explicit warning saying "These analyses can show a correlation with price movements, but not causation."
4.  **Platform Security and Access Control:** Platform access will be provided to users with unique, cancellable, and expirable API keys. Keys are generated cryptographically securely, only hashed versions are stored in the database, and the original key is only shown to the user once. This not only protects user data but also creates a robust security layer to prevent platform misuse.
5.  **Human-Centric Design:** The product will never be marketed as a fully automated Buy/Sell bot. It will always be positioned as a "human analyst-supported tool."

### 3.2. Third-Party Dependencies and Alternative Plans

**Risk (Business Model Threat):** Our business model is directly dependent on the existence and accessibility of data sources like RSS streams and Twitter outside our control. Changes in format, restriction, or significant cost to these sources can disrupt platform's data supply line and **directly affect business continuity.** This is not just a technical problem but a **fundamental commercial risk.**

**B Plan (Risk Spread Strategy):**
1.  **Source Diversification:** Data collection layer is designed to be source-independent. If Twitter is cut off, adapter will be activated for StockTwits API and more financial news sites (e.g: MarketWatch, Seeking Alpha) to maintain data diversity. Single source dependency will be minimized.
2.  **Commercial Data Agreements:** As part of long-term strategy, a portion of invested funds will be allocated to **commercial data provider agreements with professionals (e.g: AlphaVantage, Polygon.io)** to provide more reliable and stable data stream.

### 3.3. Scalability (Infrastructure Plan for 1,000+ Users)

**Database:** PostgreSQL database will be used for up to 1000 users. Read replicas will be used for heavy read operations that do not stress the main database.

**API Gateway:** As service count increases, all API requests will be managed through a centralized **API Gateway (e.g: AWS API Gateway, Kong)**. This facilitates identity verification, rate limiting, and centralized logging.

**Efficient Event-Driven Architecture:** System works with responses to changes in database. MVP phase will be provided with simple and robust periodic querying (`polling`) method. However, to maintain system performance and efficiency as user count increases, it will transition to more advanced, real-time notification mechanisms like PostgreSQL's `LISTEN/NOTIFY`. This ensures our data processing line operates close to real-time and prevents unnecessary load on the database.

**Background Tasks (Background Jobs):** These will be handled asynchronously in the background using **centralized task queue (Task Queue - e.g: Celery & Redis)** to prevent users' API requests from being held up by long-running calculations (e.g: complex backtest), and also used for platform's basic data processing and periodic tasks. Results are notified to users when they are ready.

## Section 4: Go-to-Market Strategy

### 4.1. Customer Acquisition (Customer Acquisition Plan)

**Phase 1 (First 50 Beta Users):**

- **Targeted Community Participation:** Content sharing on Subreddits like `r/algotrading`, `r/datascience`, `r/investing` to explain the problem the product solves and share value-focused content (not spam). Early-stage supporters will be gained through transparent sharing of development process.
- **Product Hunt "Future Products" Page:** A page will be created before launch to collect email list.

**Phase 2 (Scaling):**

- **Content Marketing:** Technical blog posts on topics like "How to Perform Sentiment Analysis with FinBERT?", "Paths to Backtesting Your Investment Strategy" to attract organic traffic.
- **Targeted Ads:** Low-budget ads on Google and Twitter targeting keywords like "stock market API", "sentiment analysis tool".

### 4.2. Strategic Partnerships

**Goal:** Data provider and education platform partnership.

- **Potential Partner 1: Financial Data API Providers (e.g: Alpaca, Polygon.io):** We can offer Sentilyzer as an "addon" to their customers. They provide data, we provide analysis layer.
- **Potential Partner 2: Online Education Platforms (e.g: Udemy, Coursera):** We can offer free "Educator License" to instructors in data science and finance field to use in their lessons, thereby facilitating organic spread of our product.
